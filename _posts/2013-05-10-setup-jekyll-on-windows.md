## <a id="install-ruby"></a>Install Ruby

1. Go to <http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/>

2. In "RubyInstallers" section, click a version to download.<br />
For example, `Ruby 2.0.0-p451 (x64)` is the Windows installer for Ruby 2.0.0 x64 on 64-bit machines.

3. Install through the installer

    - Keep the default directory `C:\Ruby200-x64` if possible,
    please note installer advises that "Please avoid any folder name that contains spaces (e.g. Program Files)."
    - Tick "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" checkbox, so PATH will be updated automatically to avoid headaches.

        <img itemprop="image" data-src="/assets/images/posts/2013-05-11-ruby-installer.png" src="/assets/js/unveil/loader.gif" alt="Windows Ruby installer" />
    </a>

4. Open up a command prompt window and type in the following command, to see if Ruby has been install correctly or not.
    > ruby -v

    Example output:
    > ruby 2.0.0p451 (2014-02-24) [x64-mingw32]

## <a id="install-devkit"></a>Install DevKit

The DevKit is a toolkit that makes it easy to build
and use native C/C++ extensions such as RDiscount and RedCloth for Ruby on Windows.
Detailed installation instructions can be found on its [wiki page][Full installation instructions].

1. Go to <http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/> again.

2. Download "DEVELOPMENT KIT" installer that matches the Windows architecture and the Ruby version just installed.
For instance, `DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe` is for 64-bit Windows with Ruby 2.0.0 x64.

    Here is a list about how to choose the correct DevKit version:

    > **Ruby 1.8.6 to 1.9.3**: DevKit tdm-32-4.5.2<br />
    > **Ruby 2.0.0**: DevKit mingw64-32-4.7.2<br />
    > **Ruby 2.0.0 x64**: DevKit mingw64-64-4.7.2<br />

3. Run the installer and extract it to a folder, e.g. `C:\DevKit`.

4. Initialize and create `config.yml` file. Type in the following commands in command Prompt window:

    > cd "C:\DevKit"<br />
    > ruby dk.rb init<br />
    > notepad config.yml<br />

5. In opened notepad window, add a new line `- C:\Ruby200-x64` at the end, save and close.

6. Back to the Command Prompt, review (optional) and install.

    > ruby dk.rb review<br />
    > ruby dk.rb install

## <a id="install-jekyll"></a>Install Jekyll
1. Verify that gem has been installed properly
    > gem -v

    Example output:
    > 2.0.14

2. Install Jekyll gem
    > gem install jekyll

## <a id="install-pygements"></a>Install Pygments

The default syntax highlighting engine in Jekyll is [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).
It requires Python to be installed and `highlighter` field to be set to `pygments` in site’s configuration file `_config.yml`.

Recently, Jekyll has added another highlighting engine called [Rouge](https://github.com/jayferd/rouge),
which doesn't support as many languages as Pygments at the moment, but it's Ruby native and Python-free.
More details can be followed [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code_snippet_highlighting).

### <a id="install-python"></a>Install Python
1. Go to <http://www.python.org/download/>
2. Download appropriate version of Python windows installer, e.g. `Python 2.7.6 Windows Installer`.
Note that Python 2 is preferred since Python 3 might not be functioning as intended at the time of writing.
3. Install
4. Set the installation directory (e.g. `C:\Python27`) to PATH. (How to? See [Troubleshooting #1](#troubleshooting))
5. Verify Python installation

    > python --version

    Example output:
    > Python 2.7.6

### <a id="install-easy-install"></a>Install 'Easy Install'
1. Visit <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions> for detailed installation instructions.
2. For Windows 7 machines, download [ez_setup.py](https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py)
and save it, for example, to `C:\`. Then run it using Python in a command prompt window:
> python "C:\ez_setup.py"
3. Add 'Python Scripts' directory (e.g. `C:\Python27\Scripts`) to PATH.

### <a id="install-pygements-2"></a>Install Pygments
1. Verify easy_install is installed properly
    > easy_install --version

    Example output:
    > setuptools 3.1

2. Install Pygments using "easy_install"
    > easy_install Pygments

## <a id="start-jekyll"></a>Start Jekyll
Following the commands on official [Jekyll Quick-start guide][Jekyll Quick-start guide],
a new Jekyll blog should be created and can be browsed at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
> jekyll new myblog<br />
> cd myblog<br />
> jekyll serve<br />

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
1. Error message:

        “python” is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

    **Alternatives**: "python" here can also be "ruby", "gem" or "easy_install", etc.

    **Possible Reason**: PATH for that particular program has not been set correctly.

    **Possible Solution**: Add the program to the PATH manually, see the steps below{% footnote 1 %}.
    > 1. Hold Win and press Pause.
    > 2. Click Advanced System Settings.
    > 3. Click Environment Variables.
    > 4. Append `;C:\python27` to the Path variable.
    > 5. Restart Command Prompt.

2. Error message:

        ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
                ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        "C:/Program Files/Ruby/Ruby200-x64/bin/ruby.exe" extconf.rb

        creating Makefile
        make generating stemmer-x64-mingw32.def

        make: *** [install-so] Error 1

    **Possible Reason**: Ruby has been installed to a folder with spaces.

    **Possible Solution**: Re-install Ruby, but this time install it to a folder without spaces,
    or simply keep the default directory when installing.

3. Error message:

        Generating...   Liquid Exception: No such file or directory - python c:/Ruby200-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.0/gems/pygments.rb-0.4.2/lib/pygments/mentos.py in 2013-04-22-hello-world.md

    **Possible Reason**: The PATH just set is yet to be effective.

    **Possible Solution**: First make sure no spaces or trailing slash in the PATH. Then restart Command Prompt. If it's not working, try logout Windows and log back in again.
    Or even try the ultimate and most powerful solution - "turning the computer off and on again".

4. Error message:

        c:/Ruby200-x64/lib/ruby/2.0.0/rubygems/dependency.rb:296:in `to_specs': Could not find 'pygments.rb' (~> 0.4.2) - did find: [pygments.rb-0.5.0] (Gem::LoadError)

        from c:/Ruby200-x64/bin/jekyll:22:in `<main>'`

    **Possible Reason**: As suggested in the message, pygments.rb 0.4.2 is needed, while version 0.5.0 is found.
    (This issue happened a while back with an old version of Jekyll, which should have been fixed by now.)

    **Possible Solution**: Downgrade pygments.rb gem to version 0.4.2
    > gem uninstall pygments.rb --version “=0.5.0”<br />
    > gem install pygments.rb --version “=0.4.2”

5. Error message:

        Liquid Exception: No such file or directory - /bin/sh in _posts/2013-04-22-hello-world.md

    **Possible Reason**: Incompatible issue with pygments.rb versions 0.5.1/0.5.2.

    **Possible Solution**: Downgrade pygments.rb gem from 0.5.1/0.5.2 to version 0.5.0.
    > gem uninstall pygments.rb --version '=0.5.2'<br />
    > gem install pygments.rb --version 0.5.0
